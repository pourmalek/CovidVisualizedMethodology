### Example 3: Global level and WHO regions

<br/><br/>


Here is a real-life example that explains what a researcher or advisor to policymakers would have needed to do if they wanted to examine the latest predictions by the international and periodically updated models for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic at the global level and six WHO regions, on March 15, 2022. Why March 15, 2022? Screenshots of the graphs from the models are taken on March 15, 2022. Take or give any other date, and the same process applies.

I trust that the people in charge of world health and regional health perform a similar process – among numerous others – regularly. The European CDC runs an ensemble model for short-term forecasts of Covid-19 cases and deaths across Europe ( The European Covid-19 Forecast Hub) , as does the United States CDC . 

To examine the latest predictions of daily deaths and daily cases at the global and regional levels by the international and periodically updated models, one needs to identify the models, locate their websites, find the graphs, create the missing graphs, (redevelop the existing graphs), and compile the graphs. I tried to replicate the above steps, and the results are presented below. 


<br/><br/>

***

DELP model

The DELP model does not present predictions of daily deaths and daily cases. They provide predictions of total deaths and total cases. Appendix Graphs 79 and 80 show their predictions for the global level. DELP model provides predictions for the continents. Appendix Graphs 81 and 82 show DELP predictions for Europe (the closest match for the European region used in this example), for instance.

<br/><br/>

IHME model

The IHME model does not present predictions of daily cases. They provide predictions of daily infections. See Appendix Graphs 83 and 84 below for the global level. IHME provides predictions for WHO regions and the World Bank regions. Appendix Graphs 85 and 86 show IHME predictions for the European region (WHO), for instance.

<br/><br/>

IMPE model

For the global level, Appendix Graph 87 shows their predicted daily deaths from February 2020 to February 2022. The IMPE model does not present predictions of daily cases. They provide predictions of daily infections. Their graph for the predicted daily infections at the global level is not locatable for me. The IMPE model provides some predictions for the continents. Appendix Graph 88 shows Cumulative deaths by continents together, 2020-01 to 2022-01. Appendix Graph 88 shows Cumulative Deaths since 10 deaths for seven European countries. Their graphs for the predicted daily infections at the continent level are not locatable for me.

Johns Hopkins compilation of official reports

The Johns Hopkins compilation of official reports does not present daily deaths and daily cases (as of March 15, 2022). They provide weekly deaths and weekly cases. See Appendix Graphs 89 and 90 below.

<br/><br/>

**Compile the graphs from individual models**

The DELP model does not present predictions of daily deaths and daily cases. IMPE graphs for predicted daily deaths at the continent level and daily infections at the global and continent levels are not readily locatable. The SRIV model does not provide graphs for the global and continent levels. 

Predictions of daily deaths by IHME and IMPE and the reported daily deaths by Worldometers for global level are shown below in Appendix Graph 93. Graphs of daily infections or cases are only provided by the IHME model. Therefore, it is not possible to assemble a graph by all models for the predicted daily cases or infections. For the regional or continental level, the graphs by the models are even more scarce. Only IHME provides regional-level graphs. Therefore, it is not possible to assemble a graph by all models for the predicted daily deaths or for the daily cases or infections at the regional level.

**How can the CovidVisualizedGlobal tool be practically used for the example of a researcher or advisor to policymakers who wanted to examine the latest predictions for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic at the global and WHO regional levels on March 15, 2022?** They would look at the uptake dates in the CovidVisualizedGlobal website to find the latest date equal to or before March 15, 2022. The uptake dates in the CovidVisualizedGlobal website are displayed on the top of the [main web page](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal) as the names of directories for each uptake (see Appendix Exhibit 7 below). Scroll down to find the latest uptake date equal to or before March 15, 2022. Appendix Exhibit 7 shows that the date would be 20220311. Clicking on the hyperlinked name [20220311](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311), leads to the [page for the uptake 20220311](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311) (see Appendix Exhibit 6). On the [page for the uptake 20220311](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311), [“Selected graphs”](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311#selected-graphs) can be viewed, as well as links to the [`code`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311/code) used to produce the results and the [`output`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311/output/merge) of the code. 

Appendix Graphs 94 to 129 (below) show what can be found for uptake 20220311 on the CovidVisualizedGlobal website. Official reports by the country are demonstrated as the curves drawn from the Johns Hopkins University compilation (abbreviated as “JOHN” in the graphs). Most of these graphs do not have readily locatable similars on the web that I am aware of. 

The CovidVisualizedGlobal website presents the predictions for the global and WHO regional levels in three groups: (1) The global level, (2) Regions together, and (3) Each region individually. 

Appendix Graph 94 to 125 are for the global level. Appendix Graph 94 shows all models’ predictions for Daily deaths, reference scenarios, 2020 on. Appendix Graph 95 focuses on more recent times, i.e., 2021 on. Appendix Graph 96 adds IHME excess deaths. Appendix Graph 97 adds the alternate scenarios from IHME and IMPE. Appendix Graphs 98 and 99 show alternate scenarios with uncertainty by IHME and IMPE, respectively. 


For the second outcome, i.e., daily cases or infections, Appendix Graph 100 shows the predicted Daily cases or infections, reference scenarios, 2020 on, and Appendix Graph 101 shows them for 2021 onwards. Appendix Graph 102 demonstrates Daily cases or infections, 3 scenarios, 2021 on. Graph 102 Daily cases, 2021 on by DELP and SRIV. 

Appendix Graphs 103 and 104 provide additional insight. Appendix Graph 103 shows the Daily estimated infections IHME IMPE to reported cases JOHN, main scenarios, 2021 on. Appendix Graphs 104 shows Daily deaths estimated to reported, reference scenarios, 2020 onwards.

Appendix Graphs 105 and 106 depict the hospital-related outcomes. Appendix Graph 105 shows Hospital-related outcomes, 2020 on, and Appendix Graph 106 shows Hospital-related outcomes, 2021 without IHME Bed need and IMPE Hospital demand. 

Appendix Graphs 107 to 126 demonstrate additional outcomes and variables. Appendix Graph 107 shows Daily Infection outcomes ratios, 2 scenarios, 2020 on, IHME. Appendix Graph 108 shows Daily Infection -detection and -hospitalizations ratios, 2 scenarios, 2020 on, IHME. Appendix Graph 109 depicts Daily mobility, 2 scenarios, 2020 on, IHME. Appendix Graph 110 demonstrates Daily mask use, 2 scenarios, 2020 on, IHME.

Appendix Graphs 111 to 118 are for WHO regional levels together. Appendix Graph 111 shows Daily deaths, with GLOBAL, 2020 on, JOHN. Appendix Graph 112 shows the same without the global. Appendix Graph 113 and 114 depict Daily deaths, 2022 on, JOHN, with and without the global level, respectively. The latter graph is quite illustrative of the trajectory of reported deaths by different regions. 

Appendix Graphs 115 to 118 show models’ predictions for the regional levels together. Appendix Graph 115 shows Daily infections, with GLOBAL, 2020 on, IHME, IMPE. Appendix Graph 116 shows the same without the global level. Appendix Graph 117 shows Daily cases, with GLOBAL, 2022 on, DELP, SRIV, and Appendix Graph 118 shows the same without the global level. 

Appendix Graphs 119 to 124 show the predicted total deaths. Appendix Graphs 119 and 120 show Total deaths, with GLOBAL, 2020 on, IHME, IMPE and Total deaths, without GLOBAL, 2020 on, IHME, IMPE. Appendix Graphs 121 and 122 show Total deaths, with GLOBAL, 2022 on, DELP, SRIV, and Total deaths, without GLOBAL, DELP, SRIV. Appendix Graphs 123 and 124 depict  Total excess deaths, with GLOBAL, 2020 on, IHME and Total excess deaths, without GLOBAL, 2020 on, IHME. Appendix Graphs 125 and 126 show Total cases, with GLOBAL, 2022 on, DELP, SRIV and Total cases, without GLOBAL, 2022 on, DELP, SRIV. 

<br/><br/>

Four graphs are provided for each WHO region: (1) Daily deaths, reference scenarios, 2020 on, (2) Daily deaths, 3 scenarios, 2021 on, (3) Daily cases or infections, reference scenarios, 2020 on, and (4) Daily cases or infections, 3 scenarios, 2021 on. Appendix Graphs 127 to 130 show those predictions for the European region, for instance. Graphs for other regions are not shown here to save space. Graphs other than the daily deaths and infections for each of the regions are available in the [“merge”](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/tree/main/20220311/output/merge) directory  – for instance, [Daily cases or infections, EURO, Reference scenarios with uncertainty, 2021 on](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/blob/main/20220311/output/merge/graph%20EURO%2023%20C-19%20daily%20cases%2C%20EURO%2C%20reference%20scenarios%2C%202021%2C%20uncertainty.pdf), or [Daily cases or infections, EURO, Reference scenarios with alternate scenarios, 2021 on](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedGlobal/blob/main/20220311/output/merge/graph%20EURO%2024%20C-19%20daily%20cases%2C%20EURO%2C%203%20scenarios%2C%202021%2C%20uncertainty.pdf). 

**Here is the bottom-line conclusion from this example of a researcher or advisor to policymakers who wanted to examine the latest predictions for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic at the global and WHO regional levels on March 15, 2022 – and how the CovidVisualizedGlobal tool can help.** One can locate the latest predictions by the international and periodically updated models and come up with some sort of incomplete compilation of daily deaths graphs for the global level like the Appendix Graph 93 (above) made here. It is not possible to create similar graphs for the daily cases or infections for the global level, or any meaningful graphs for the regional levels. While Appendix Graph 93 is the only graph that can be compiled for daily deaths or daily cases at the global and regional levels (without creating the missing graphs), the graphs compiled in the CovidVisualizedGlobal tool are much more meaningful. Moreover, they demonstrate different aspects like calendar time intervals, different scenarios, mean estimates and confidence intervals, and individual models’ details. The software code used to produce the graphs is accessible  and can be rerun by others to verify the correctness and potential mistakes. The track record of the previous periodical uptakes is also accessible – via RESULTS GLOBAL 2021, RESULTS GLOBAL 2022, RESULTS Regions together, RESULTS European region, and similar web pages shown at the root of the CovidVisualizedGlobal website for other regions. The CovidVisualizedGlobal uptake 20220311 also adds the following summary by its creator, and puts all the graphs in “GLOBAL and REGIONAL COVID-19 epidemic models situation report No 35 - 2022-03-11”.

<br/><br/>

**Summary 20220311:**

**Observation:**

Reported COVID-19 daily deaths are bouncing up at the Global level, in Europe, Canada and USA, and continuing to rise in the Western Pacific region.

Reported COVID-19 daily cases are bouncing up at the Global level and in Europe, continuing to rise in the Western Pacific region, and stagnating from the previous decrease in other regions.

**Probability:**

 

**Even though the models are highly divergent about the future trajectory of the pandemic, the above-observed trajectories of the reported daily deaths and cases might signify _a new surge_.**
