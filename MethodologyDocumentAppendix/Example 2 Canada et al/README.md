### Example 2: Canada and its province

<br/><br/>

Below is a real-life example that explains what a researcher or advisor to policymakers would have needed to do if they wanted to examine the latest predictions by the international and periodically updated models for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada and its provinces and territories, on March 14, 2022. 

To examine the latest predictions of daily deaths and daily cases in Canada and its subnational levels by the international and periodically updated models, one needs to identify the models, locate their websites, find the graphs, create the missing graphs, (redevelop the available graphs), and compile the graphs. I tried to replicate the above steps, and the results are presented below. 



<br/><br/>

***

DELP model

The DELP model does not present daily deaths and daily cases predictions – they provide total deaths and total cases. The DELP model provides predictions for nine provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Appendix Graphs 34 and 35 show their predictions for Canada at the national level. Appendix Graphs 36 and 37 show DELP predictions for British Columbia, for instance.

<br/><br/>

IHME model

The IHME model does not present predictions of daily cases. They provide predictions of daily infections. See Appendix Graphs 38 and 39 below. IHME provides predictions for seven provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Appendix Graphs 40 and 41 show IHME predictions for British Columbia, for instance.

**Compile the graphs from individual models

The DELP model does not present predictions of daily deaths and daily cases. Predictions of daily deaths by IHME, IMPE, and SRIV, and reported daily deaths by Worldometers for Canada at the national level are shown below in Appendix Graph 50. Appendix Graph 51 shows the predicted daily cases by SRIV, predicted daily infections by IHME and IMPE, and the reported daily cases by Worldometers. The DELP and IHME models provide predictions at the subnational level. Transforming the predictions of total deaths and total cases to daily deaths and daily cases needs calculations – performed in the CovidVisualized tools. Therefore, without the CovidVisualized tools, the predictions for the subnational levels are comprised only of those provided by IHME (Appendix Graphs 40 and 41 above).

**How can the CovidVisualizedCountry tool be practically used for the example of a researcher or advisor to policymakers who wanted to examine the latest predictions for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada on March 14, 2022?** They would look at the uptake dates in the CovidVisualizedCountry website to find the latest date equal to or before March 14, 2022. The uptake dates in the CovidVisualizedCountry website are displayed on the top of the [main web page](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry) as the names of directories for each uptake (see Appendix Exhibit 4 below). Scroll down to find the latest uptake date equal to or before March 14, 2022. Appendix Exhibit 5 shows that the date would be 20220311. Clicking on the hyperlinked name [`20220311`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/20220311), leads to the [page for the uptake 20220311](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/20220311) (see Appendix Exhibit 6). On the page for the [uptake 20220311](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/20220311), [“Selected graphs”](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/20220311#selected-graphs) can be viewed, as well as links to the [`code`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/20220311/code) used to produce the results and the [`output`](https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry/tree/main/20220311/output/merge) of the code. 

<br/><br/>

Appendix Graphs 52 to 79 (below) show what can be found for uptake 20220311 on the CovidVisualizedCountry website. Official reports by the country are demonstrated as the curves drawn from the Johns Hopkins University compilation (abbreviated as “JOHN” in the graphs). 

The CovidVisualizedCountry website presents the predictions for Canada and its subnational levels in three groups: (1) The national level, (2) Provinces together, and (3) Each province individually. 

Appendix Graph 52 to 61 are for the national level. Appendix Graph 52 shows all models’ predictions for Daily deaths, all-time, i.e., from January 2020 to the latest date available in the models. Appendix Graph 53 focuses on more recent time, i.e.,  2021 on. For the second outcome, i.e., daily cases, Appendix Graph 54 shows the predicted Daily cases or infections, all-time, and Appendix Graph 55 shows the predicted Daily cases or infections, 2021 on. 

Appendix Graphs 56 to 61 demonstrate additional outcomes and variables. Appendix Graphs 56 and 57 provide predicted hospital-related outcomes. Appendix Graph 56 shows all the Hospital-related outcomes, all-time and by all models. Appendix Graph 57 removes the outcomes whose larger sizes compress the curves of outcomes with lower values and focuses on more recent time interval.  There are no readily accessible similar graphs available on the web as far as I know. 

Appendix Graphs 58 to 61 show additional variables estimated by the IHME model: Appendix Graph 58, Daily Infection-detection, Infection-hospitalization, and Infection-fatality ratios, 2021 on, IHME; Appendix Graph 59, Daily Infection-detection, Infection-hospitalization, and Infection-fatality ratios, 2021 onwards, IHME; Appendix Graph 60, Daily mask use, IHME, 2020 on; and Appendix Graph 61, Percent cumulative vaccinated, 2021 on, IHME.

Appendix Graph 62 to 76 are for Canadian Provinces together. Appendix Graph 62 shows Daily reported deaths, JOHN, 2020 on, for eight provinces and the national level. Appendix Graphs 63 and 64 show the same for 2021 on and 2022, respectively. The values of the reported deaths for the national level, Ontario, and Quebec and much higher than those for other provinces. Removing the former group would show the latter’s trajectory more efficiently – that is the Appendix Graphs 65, Reported deaths, Canada without the national level, Ontario, and Quebec, JOHN, 2022. The recent two graphs show the reported daily deaths are mainly on the rise. Graphs 66, 67, 68, and 69 provide the counterpart results for reported daily cases. 

Appendix Graphs 70 to 75 demonstrate predictions by IHME for provinces together. Appendix Graph 70 shows Daily deaths, Reference scenario, IHME, 2020 on. Appendix Graphs 71 and 72 show similar results for 2021 on and 2020, respectively. Appendix Graphs 73, 74, and 75 show counterpart results for predicted daily infections. 

<br/><br/>

Four graphs are provided for each province: (1) Daily deaths, Reference scenario, 2020 on, (2) Daily deaths, Reference scenario, 2021 on, (3)  Daily cases or infections, Reference scenario, 2020 on, and (4) Daily cases or infections, Reference scenario, 2021 on. Appendix Graphs 76 to 79 show those predictions for British Columbia, for instance. Graphs for other provinces are not shown here to save space. Graphs other than the daily deaths and case or infections (mean estimates) for each of the provinces are available in the merge directory of the output: CovidVisualizedCountry/20220311/output/merge/ – for instance, COVID-19 daily cases, Canada, Ontario, reference scenarios with uncertainty, 2021, or COVID-19 hospital-related outcomes, Canada, Quebec, without extremes (IHME Bed need, IMPE Hospital demand), Reference scenarios, 2021 on.

<br/><br/>

**Here is the bottom-line conclusion from this example of a researcher or advisor to policymakers who wanted to examine the latest predictions for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada on March 14, 2022 – and how the CovidVisualizedCountry tool can help.** One can locate the latest predictions by the international and periodically updated models and come up with some sort of compilation of graphs like the Appendix Graphs 50 and 51 made here, or similar graphs for other outcomes. In the meantime, Appendix Graph 52 to 55 show the equivalent of those compilations of graphs for the national level, readily available via the CovidVisualizedCountry tool. Appendix Graphs 77 to 78 show the CovidVisualizedCountry complied graphs for British Columbia. The graphs compiled in the CovidVisualizedCountry tool are much more usable and demonstrate different aspects like calendar time intervals, different scenarios, mean estimates and confidence intervals, and individual models’ details. The software code used to produce the graphs is accessible  and can be rerun by others to verify the correctness and potential mistakes. The track record of the previous periodical uptakes is also accessible – via RESULTS CANADA, national 2021, RESULTS CANADA, national 2022, RESULTS CANADA, provinces 2021, RESULTS CANADA, provinces 2022, RESULTS British Columbia 2021, RESULTS British Columbia 2022, and similar web pages shown in the root of the CovidVisualizedCountry website. The CovidVisualizedCountry uptake 20220311 also adds the following summary by its creator, and puts all the graphs in “Canada COVID-19 epidemic models situation report No 38 – 2022-03-11.pdf”.


Summary 20220311:

<br/><br/>
Observation:

Reported daily cases are stagnating after their recent decrease at the national level and in all provinces.

Reported daily deaths have stopped decreasing after their recent decrease at the national level and in all provinces. They stagnate in Ontario and Quebec and increase Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba. Reporting by Saskatchewan is grossly manipulated and unreliable.


Probability:

 
Even though the models are highly divergent about the future trajectory of the epidemic, the above-observed trajectories of the reported daily deaths and cases might signify a new surge.
